# hacktoberfest2019

This is a repository for all the aspiring people who want to participate in hacktoberfest and learn the basics about git.

Basic instructions, all you need to do is solve any 5 problems on any coding website like hackerrank, leetcode, hackerearth etc, and make a pull request on this repository and become a contributor. Once, your five(5) requests are approved, you'll successfully complete the hacktoberfest. 

I'll add the instructions about contributing in this project in a day or two.

Happy coding.
